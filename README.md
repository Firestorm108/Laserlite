# Laserlite
A 500mW laser engraver that stays within an $85 budget. It is able to engrave most woods while being able to cut materials like paper and cardboard. Extremely thin wood can be cut with multiple passes but this laser is 90% for engraving materials. I designed this because I wanted to build a small cheap laser CNC machine to engrave on small objects without having to pull out a higher wattage machine.
