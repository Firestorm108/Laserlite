<h1>August 8th</h1>

Just finished building 3 highway projects! Time to get on the grounded grind now. I started by making the bom for the project, and it comes out to around ~$73 which is great for an engraver!
After that, I put the stepper motor in with the pulley. I also added double shear.

After that I added the second y-axis stepper motor and the support rods.

After that I finished the y-axis and the belt tensioning system. I'm gonna go to sleep now and do the rest tomorrow.
